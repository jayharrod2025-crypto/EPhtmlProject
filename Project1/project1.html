<li>Certain species of wasp, known as parasitoids, inject their eggs into the eggs or bodies of other arthropods for them to grow, eventually killing the host</li>

<li>Some parasitoids go after plants, laying eggs in their leaves and causing small bumps to form on the structure around the developing larvae</li>

<li>Platypi, despite being mammals, have beaks (or something similar), lay eggs, and sweat milk instead of having set glands like other mammals</li>

<li>Male platypi also have spurs in their hindlegs that inject extremely painful venom that can persist for months, and there is no antivenom</li>

<li>Platypi are one of five species of monotreme, which are Earth's egg-laying mammals</li>

<li>The other four species are all different species of echidna, the short-beaked, eastern long-beaked, western long-beaked, and Sir David's long-beaked, often called spiky anteaters due to their quills</li>

<li>Some species of turtle that live in oceans or bodies of water that periodically freeze over can breathe through their rumps</li>

<li>The animals that share the most similarly-coded genome to the hippopotamus, which means water-horse, are cetaceans like whales, as well as porcine animals like pigs</li>

<li>Humans share more than %90 percent of their genome with apes from the pan genus, bonobos and chimpanzees</li>
